My name is Ed Donner. I'm an entrepreneur, software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from London, England, but I moved to NYC in 2000.
I love all foods, particularly French food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
