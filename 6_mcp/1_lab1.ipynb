I asked o3 with Deep Research to try to find workarounds; it <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/6817bbc3-3d0c-8012-9b51-631842470628\">confirmed the issue</a> and confirmed the workaround.<br/><br/>\n",
    "            The workaround is a bit of a bore. It is to take advantage of \"WSL\", the Microsoft approach for running Linux on your PC. You'll need to carry out more setup instructions! But it's quick, and several students have confirmed that this works perfectly for them, then the Week 6 MCP labs work. Plus, WSL is actually a great way to build software on your Windows PC.<br/>\n",
    "            The WSL Setup instructions are in the Setup folder, <a href=\"../setup/SETUP-WSL.md\">in the file called SETUP-WSL.md here</a>. I do hope this only holds you up briefly - you should be back up and running quickly. Oh the joys of working with bleeding-edge technology!<br/><br/>\n",
