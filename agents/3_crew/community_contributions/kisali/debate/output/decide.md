Based on the arguments presented, the side advocating for strict laws and regulations governing LLMs appears to be more convincing. The arguments emphasize the significant risks and potential harms posed by LLMs, such as the generation and dissemination of misinformation, biased or discriminatory content, and malicious or illegal content. The proponents of strict regulations highlight the need for clear guidelines, ethical standards, and accountability measures to mitigate these risks while allowing for responsible innovation and beneficial applications of LLMs.

The arguments against overly strict laws and regulations focus on the potential for stifling innovation, the rapid pace of technological advancements, and the challenges of enforcing regulations across borders and jurisdictions. While these concerns are valid, they do not outweigh the potential risks and harms posed by LLMs if left unchecked.

In conclusion, the side advocating for strict laws and regulations governing LLMs presents a more compelling case, as it prioritizes the protection of fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression, privacy, and access to accurate information, while also promoting responsible development and use of LLMs.
