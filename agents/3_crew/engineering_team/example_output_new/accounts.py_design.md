# Module: accounts.py

This module implements a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. It provides functionality for creating accounts, managing funds, recording transactions, calculating portfolio value, and generating reports.

## Class: Account

### Description:
The `Account` class models a user's account in the trading simulation platform. It handles fund management, share transactions, and provides methods for generating reports regarding the user's financial activities.

### Attributes:
- `user_id: str` - Unique identifier for the user.
- `balance: float` - Current cash balance in the user's account.
- `initial_deposit: float` - The initial deposit amount at account creation for profit/loss calculations.
- `holdings: dict` - A dictionary mapping stock symbols to the quantity of shares owned by the user.
- `transactions: list` - A list of transaction records detailing past deposits, withdrawals, and share trades.

### Methods:

#### `__init__(self, user_id: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
- Initializes a new Account object with a unique user ID and initial deposit.
- Sets the initial balance to the value of the initial deposit.
- Initializes holdings and transactions with empty structures.

#### `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
- Adds specified amount to the user's account balance.
- Records the transaction in the transactions list.

#### `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`
- Attempts to withdraw the specified amount from the user's balance.
- Checks if funds are sufficient; if so, updates the balance and records transaction.
- Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Buys the specified quantity of shares for a given stock symbol.
- Retrieves current share price using `get_share_price(symbol)`.
- Checks if funds are sufficient; if so, updates balance, holdings, and records transaction.
- Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Sells the specified quantity of shares for a given stock symbol.

- Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
- Calculates the total value of the user's portfolio by summing the value of all shares owned and the current balance.
- Uses `get_share_price(symbol)` to fetch the current price of each stock.

#### `calculate_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`
- Calculates the user's current profit or loss since the initial deposit by subtracting the initial deposit from the portfolio value.

#### `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
- Returns a dictionary of current stock holdings with quantities.

#### `get_transactions(self) -> list`
- Returns a list of all transactions performed by the user.

#### `get_report(self) -> dict`
- Returns a comprehensive report including current balance, holdings, portfolio value, and profit/loss.
