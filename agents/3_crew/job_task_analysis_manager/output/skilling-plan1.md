Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect Skilling Plan

Main Task 1: Develop and Design Security Strategies Based on Zero Trust Principles  
- Understand and articulate core Zero Trust security concepts; map organizational assets and data flows (measurable by architecture diagrams and policy documentation).  
- Design identity and access management (IAM) solutions utilizing Azure AD Conditional Access, Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and Azure AD Identity Protection.  
- Develop network segmentation, microsegmentation strategies including Azure Firewall, Azure Virtual Networks (VNets), and Azure Private Link.  
- Create data protection and classification strategies using Microsoft Information Protection (MIP), Azure Purview, and Azure Rights Management (RMS).  
- Collaborate with business and IT stakeholders to align security architecture with organizational goals and communicate risk mitigation strategies.

Main Task 2: Implement Security Solutions Across Microsoft Ecosystems  
- Deploy, configure, and manage Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to secure endpoints and enable advanced threat detection and remediation.  
- Implement Azure Security Center (Microsoft Defender for Cloud) and Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) to enable continuous security posture management and incident detection.  
- Configure Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) for Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) capabilities to monitor and protect SaaS applications.  
- Enable and manage encryption, certificate management, and key vaulting through Azure Key Vault and Azure Disk Encryption.  
- Provide clear documentation and communicate security architecture and configurations effectively to IT operations and cybersecurity teams.

Main Task 3: Design and Manage Security Operations and Incident Response Frameworks  
- Develop and maintain security operations workflows and monitoring frameworks using Microsoft Sentinel analytics, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics workspace.  
- Design incident response playbooks and automate response actions with Microsoft Sentinel SOAR capabilities and Azure Logic Apps.  
- Conduct proactive threat hunting exercises and vulnerability assessments using Microsoft Threat Intelligence and Defender tools.  
- Establish logging, auditing, and compliance reporting policies leveraging Azure Monitor Logs, Microsoft Defender logs, and Azure Security Center alerts.  
- Coordinate cross-team incident response drills, post-incident analyses, and continuous process improvements with stakeholders.

Main Task 4: Ensure Regulatory Compliance, Governance, and Risk Management  
- Analyze and interpret regulatory and compliance requirements relevant to the organization (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, NIST, ISO 27001) and map to Microsoft Compliance frameworks.  
- Develop governance frameworks and control implementations with Microsoft Information Protection, Microsoft Compliance Manager, and Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal.  
- Deploy and manage Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies across Microsoft 365 environments to safeguard sensitive data.  
- Perform regular risk assessments, document mitigation strategies, and maintain a risk register aligned with organizational risk appetite.  
- Generate and present compliance status, risk assessment reports, and governance metrics to executives and auditors.

Main Task 5: Continuously Update Knowledge and Collaborate Effectively  
- Monitor Microsoft security advisories, patch releases, threat intelligence feeds, and emerging cybersecurity trends to stay current.  
- Engage actively in Microsoft cybersecurity communities, forums, official Microsoft Learn training, and pursue certifications such as Microsoft Certified: Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals (SC-900), Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500), and Microsoft Certified: Security Operations Analyst (SC-200).  
- Deliver security awareness training and workshops for IT and development teams to embed security best practices.  
- Collaborate with software development and DevOps teams to integrate security into CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and GitHub Advanced Security.  
- Communicate risk posture, security initiatives, and strategic recommendations clearly to technical teams and executive leadership.

This skilling plan encompasses the critical technical and collaborative tasks Microsoft Cybersecurity Architects regularly perform, provides clear learning pathways referencing key Microsoft security technologies, and emphasizes measurable outcomes to guide proficiency development.
