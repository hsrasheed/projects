    "1.2 Scope: The system will be a web-based application providing a full range of e-commerce functionalities, from user registration and product browsing to secure payment processing and order management.\n",
    "1.3 Intended Audience: This document is intended for project managers, developers, quality assurance engineers, and stakeholders involved in the development and maintenance of the Juice Shop platform.\n",
    "2. Overall Description\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Product Perspective: A customer-facing, scalable, and secure e-commerce website with a comprehensive administrative backend.\n",
    "2.2 Product Features:\n",
    "Secure user registration and authentication with multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n",
    "A product catalog with detailed descriptions, images, pricing, and stock levels.\n",
    "Advanced search and filtering capabilities for products.\n",
    "A secure shopping cart and checkout process integrating with a trusted payment gateway.\n",
    "User profile management, including order history, shipping addresses, and payment information.\n",
    "An administrative dashboard for managing products, inventory, orders, and customer data.\n",
    "2.3 User Classes and Characteristics:\n",
    "Customer: A registered or guest user who can browse products, make purchases, and manage their account.\n",
    "Administrator: An authorized employee who can manage the platform's content and operations.\n",
    "Customer Service Representative: An authorized employee who can assist customers with orders and account issues.\n",
    "3. System Features\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 Functional Requirements:\n",
    "User Management:\n",
    "Users shall be able to register for a new account with a unique email address and a strong password.\n",
    "The system shall enforce strong password policies (e.g., length, complexity, and expiration).\n",
    "Users shall be able to log in securely and enable/disable MFA.\n",
    "Users shall be able to reset their password through a secure, token-based process.\n",
    "Product Management:\n",
    "The system shall display products with accurate information, including price, description, and availability.\n",
    "Administrators shall be able to add, update, and remove products from the catalog.\n",
    "Order Processing:\n",
    "The system shall process orders through a secure, PCI-compliant payment gateway.\n",
    "The system shall encrypt all sensitive customer and payment data.\n",
    "Customers shall receive email confirmations for orders and shipping updates.\n",
    "3.2 Non-Functional Requirements:\n",
    "Security:\n",
    "All data transmission shall be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.\n",
    "The system shall be protected against common web vulnerabilities, including the OWASP Top 10 (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF).\n",
    "Regular security audits and penetration testing shall be conducted.\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "The website shall load in under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.\n",
    "The system shall handle at least 1,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.\n",
    "Reliability: The system shall have an uptime of 99.9% or higher.\n",
    "Usability: The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate for all user types.\n",
