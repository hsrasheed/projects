    "Unfortunately, it's a bit of PITA to get acess and refresh tokens for Spotify.  The process requires connecting to an authentication end point while logged in to Spotify and then processing a callback.  To make this easier, instructions along with a small app that can be deployed to HuggingFace Spaces using Gradio are included at the end of this notebook. "
