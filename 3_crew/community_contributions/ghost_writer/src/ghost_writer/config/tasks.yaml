act1_development_task:
  description: >
    Create a detailed outline of the first act of the novel, including character introductions, setting, and 
    inciting incidents.

    Purpose: Introduce the world, characters, and status quo.  Establish stakes.
      - Hook: Something that grabs attention immediately (mystery, unusual voie, threat, or intrigue)
      - Exposition: Introduce setting, protagonist, tone, and rules of the world.
      - Inciting Incident: A distruption to the protagonist's life that demands a response.
      - Plot Point 1 - A choice or event that propels the character into the main conflict or journey.

    IMPORTANT: 
      - Never use structural terms like "Act 1", or "Inciting Incident" in the outline. Act titles, 
        descriptions, etc. should be creative and engaging.
      - Never use colons in the outline as they might interfere with text generation processes. This includes
        other characters like dashes when used as delimiting characters.
      - Never use numbering in the outline titles.  For example "Chaapter 6: Clay Memory-Fragments" should
        be "Clay Memory-Fragments" instead.
