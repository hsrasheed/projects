## Class: Account

The `Account` class is responsible for managing all user account operations including fund management, trading transactions, and reporting.

### `__init__(self, account_id: str)`

- Initializes a new account with a unique `account_id`.
- Initializes attributes for balance, portfolio holdings, transaction history, and initial deposit.

### `deposit(self, amount: float) -> bool`

- Adds funds to the user's account.
- Returns `True` if successful, `False` for invalid operations (like depositing a negative amount).

### `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`

- Withdraws funds from the user's account.
- Ensures the operation doesn't result in a negative balance.
- Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, get_share_price: callable) -> bool`

- Buys shares of the given `symbol` at the current price returned by `get_share_price(symbol)`.
- Updates the portfolio holdings and updates the transaction history.
- Ensures the user has enough balance to make the purchase.
- Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, get_share_price: callable) -> bool`

- Sells shares of the given `symbol`.
- Updates the portfolio holdings and updates the transaction history.
- Ensures the user has enough shares to sell.
- Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

### `get_portfolio_value(self, get_share_price: callable) -> float`

- Calculates the total current value of the user's portfolio using the latest prices from `get_share_price`.
- Returns the calculated value.

### `get_profit_or_loss(self, get_share_price: callable) -> float`

- Calculates the user's profit or loss from their initial deposit.
- Considers current portfolio value and current balance.
- Returns the profit or loss amount.

### `get_holdings(self) -> dict`

- Returns a dictionary representing the user's current share holdings with share symbols and corresponding quantities.

### `get_transactions(self) -> list`

- Returns a list of all transactions the user has made over time.
- Transactions include deposits, withdrawals, buy, and sell orders.

### `can_withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`

- Checks if the user can withdraw the specified amount without resulting in a negative balance.
- Used internally for validation in `withdraw`.

### `can_buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, get_share_price: callable) -> bool`

- Checks if the user can afford to buy the specified quantity of shares at the current price.
- Used internally for validation in `buy_shares`.

### `can_sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`

- Checks if the user owns enough shares to sell the specified quantity.
- Used internally for validation in `sell_shares`.

This design encapsulates all functionality needed for an account management system within a trading simulation platform. Each method is responsible for a distinct operation aligning with the given requirements. The class ensures data integrity and follows access controls to prevent invalid transactions.
