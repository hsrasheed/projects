Companies not selected:

1. Epic MegaGrants: Despite substantial investment opportunities within the gaming and technology sectors, the focus on funding via the initiative may dilute direct investment returns. It is overshadowed by LumeCube's more direct consumer engagement and product-driven growth strategy.

2. Synapse: While promising in fintech innovations, the operational and regulatory challenges, alongside competition, make it less favorable compared to LumeCubeâ€™s well-defined market and product alignment with prevailing trends.

3. Boom Supersonic: Although they present exciting pre-IPO investments with advancements in supersonic travel and strong partnerships, the challenges in regulation and certification pose substantial risks. LumeCube's current and tested market offerings offer a more reliable investment path.
