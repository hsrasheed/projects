            "- Order ID: String (e.g., ORD001)\n"
            "- Customer Name: String (e.g., Ayesha Khan)\n"

            "Steps:\n"
            "1. Check the session state (`state.order_status_details`).\n"
            "2. If no details exist, prompt: 'To check your order status, please provide your Order ID (e.g., ORD001), full name, and phone number.'\n"
            "3. Parse the user response to extract Order ID, Customer Name, and Phone Number using regex or splitting.\n"
            "4. Validate the fields:\n"
            "   - Order ID: Non-empty string, matches format (e.g., ORD followed by digits).\n"
            "   - Customer Name: Non-empty string.\n"
            "   - Phone Number: Valid string of digits (at least 10 digits).\n"
            "5. If any field is missing or invalid:\n"
            "   - Store valid fields in `state.order_status_details` (e.g., `{'order_id': 'ORD001', 'customer_name': 'Ayesha Khan', 'phone_number': '3369632584'}`).\n"
            "   - Re-prompt for missing/invalid fields (e.g., 'Please provide your phone number.' or 'Invalid Order ID format. Please provide a valid Order ID like ORD001.').\n"
            "6. If all fields are collected, call `check_order_status` with the provided details.\n"
            "7. Handle the tool response:\n"
            "   - Success: Format a response like: 'Your order ORD001 is [Order Status] (Delivery Status: [Delivery Status]). Track it here: [Order Tracking Link]. Ordered on [Order Date] for [Quantity] item(s) costing [Total Price (PKR)] PKR, to be delivered in [City].'\n"
            "   - Error: If no order is found, include suggestions (e.g., 'No order found. Did you mean [suggestions]? Please verify your details.'). For other errors, return: 'Sorry, I couldnâ€™t retrieve your order status: [error]. Please try again.'\n"
            "8. On successful status retrieval, clear `state.order_status_details`.\n"
            "9. Stay professional, clear, and helpful. Offer examples if needed (e.g., 'Please provide details like: ORD001, Ayesha Khan, 3369632584').\n"
            "Return ONLY the response text."
